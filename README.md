# NonlinearTensorClassifier
This is the code for the papers "Tensor-Based Classification Models forHyperspectral Data Analysis" and "Tensor-based Nonlinear Classifier for High-Order Data Analysis".

The code is written in Python and requires the Theano package.

From the files that you will download you have to simply run the RANK_1_FNN.py to see how this method works on the Pavia University.

You should also download the Pavia University dataset from http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes or follow the quick links below.

Data: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/uploads/e/ee/PaviaU.mat

Ground truth: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/uploads/5/50/PaviaU_gt.mat

Finally, the dataset and the code should be at the same folder.
